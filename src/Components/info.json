    "sContext": "I am a registered nurse turned software developer with experience working in high stress, fast paced environments.  I have been on multiple projects within the energy sector, building custom web applications for large corporations.",
    "sMoreContext": "From 2018-2020, I worked on different projects in various roles at IBM: GBS North America. My official role was \"SAP Technical Specialist;\" however, this role had many hats. I created custom web applications using SAP's UI5 framework that were integrated into their Fiori dashboard. I worked an assistant system administrator to configure new SAP servers for Fiori use and added users with roles onto those servers. I worked as a technical consultant for Fiori, where I troubleshooted system errors, deployed new applications to the dashboard, and worked with backend/security professionals to get applications working properly. I often worked remotely with a global team, but I occasionally traveled to client sites to do on-site work. I consulted on web applications with project owners, business leads, and UX designers to increase app efficiency and provide a better UX for the end user. \n\nI made the decision to return to nursing temporarily in July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, where I felt I was of more immediate use to my community. Being a registered nurse in the emergency room for 8 years has given me many skills to succeed as a software developer. I excel in time management, critical thinking in stressful situations, the ability to communicate both with a team and across disciplines, attention to details, and problem solving",
